CSS Color Markers
CSS Color Markers is a simple HTML and CSS project that demonstrates the styling of colored marker representations using gradients and shadows. This project is a great example of how to use CSS gradients, box shadows, and layout properties to create visual effects resembling real-life markers.

Features
1. Marker Designs
Three marker representations in red, green, and blue.
Each marker consists of two sections: the cap and the sleeve.
The markers are styled using CSS linear gradients to mimic a smooth color transition, giving each marker a realistic 3D appearance.
2. CSS Effects
Gradients: Each marker uses a linear gradient to create depth and visual appeal.
Red Marker: Uses shades of red and pink.
Green Marker: Uses shades of green and yellow.
Blue Marker: Uses shades of blue.
Box Shadows: Applied to create a glowing effect that enhances the realism of each marker.
3. Responsive Layout
The markers are centered on the page with consistent spacing and aligned for a clean, minimalist layout.
The project uses simple, flexible CSS to ensure the markers scale nicely on different screen sizes.
Project Structure
HTML (index.html): The main structure of the webpage includes a container with three marker divs (red, green, and blue).
CSS (styles.css): Handles the styling of the markers, including colors, shadows, and layout properties.
